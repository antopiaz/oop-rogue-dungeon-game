# Java Guys Rogue Dungeon Game
Group members: Miles Zheng, Kevin Wang

## How to use

TODO: Instructions on how to get a local copy up and running.

## Project Requirements

* Must use and identify 5 design patterns
* You should use dependency injection where possible
* Code to abstractions
* Treat things polymorphically: no big if-then-else or switch statements
* Must have either a UI or some form of persisted state (ORM, file, database)

### Design patterns
* Factory for items, creatures
* Builder for dungeon and rooms
* Decorator for equipping items
* Strategy for creature's game tree
* Facade for game setup and playing

## Ideas for Game Features

* Random dungeon generator? n x n grid for now
* ASCII UI that changes from observers any time game changes
* Fighting = rock paper scissors (strike grapple lunge)
* Run via exe file or somthing similar
* Map that shows entire dungeon
